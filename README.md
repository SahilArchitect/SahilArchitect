### ### CURRENT OPERATION: FERROUS CORE LABS
I am architecting the infrastructure for the next era of industrial autonomy.
* **The Core**: High-concurrency AI inference layers.
* **The Engine**: Python, FastAPI, Redis, and Celery.
* **The Protocol**: Digital Nomad. Asynchronous by design. 100% Remote.

---

### ### SYSTEM R&D (2022 - 2026)
While the industry chased "culture," I mastered the physics of distributed systems.
* **M.Tech**: Data Science @ Indian Institute of Technology Jammu (2022).
* **Stealth Phase**: 3.4 years of deep-level optimization and architectural research.

### ### THE TECHNICAL MATRIX
| Component | Implementation |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Logic Layer** | Python, FastAPI |
| **State/Cache** | Redis |
| **Concurrency** | Celery, RabbitMQ |
| **Infrastructure** | Docker, Linux, Git |

### ### SYSTEM FLOW
I build for zero latency. Every microsecond is a bottleneck.



---

### ### THE EMPIRE BLUEPRINT (20-Year Roadmap)
I build for Vertical Sovereignty. My systems bridge the gap between raw atoms and orbital infrastructure.
1. **Entity A**: Autonomous Urban Mining (Computer Vision + Robotics).
2. **Entity B**: Precision Vacuum Manufacturing.
3. **Entity C**: Orbital Assembly and Construct.

---

### ### STATUS LOG
* 🟢 **Available for**: High-leverage technical partnerships and AI backend engineering.
* 🔴 **Unavailable for**: Synchronous meetings, "culture fit" interviews, and slow code.
